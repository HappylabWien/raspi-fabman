# raspi-fabman

[Fabman](https://fabman.io) is an all-in-one makerspace management solution. It is the "operating system" for makerspaces, fab labs, coworking spaces or school workshops. It helps to manage machines and members easily, safely & efficiently. `raspi-faman` is an open source library written in python3, with the help of which you can build your own [Fabman](https://fabman.io)-compatible hardware. 

Specific use cases are described in detail below:
- [MicroPOS](https://github.com/HappylabWien/raspi-fabman/blob/master/README.md#micropos): Point of sale solution for Fabman
- [Vending Machine](https://github.com/HappylabWien/raspi-fabman/blob/master/README.md#vending-machine): Vending machine to sell consumables which charges automatically via Fabman
- *...more use cases coming soon...*

We will gradually expand the list and we look forward to your feedback.

**This project is under development and not yet tested!!! Use it at your own risk.**

## MicroPOS

MicroPOS is a simple point of sale solution for Fabman based on a Raspberry Pi.

The sales process is then very simple and intuitive:
1. Scan the items you want
2. Swipe a member card to complete the sale
3. An invoice line is then automatically created for the member.

### Hardware Setup

#### Bill of Materials

All you need is 
- a [RasPi 3 B+](https://www.amazon.de/UCreate-Raspberry-Pi-Desktop-Starter/dp/B07BNPZVR7), 
- a [display](https://www.amazon.de/AZDelivery-Display-Arduino-Raspberry-Gratis/dp/B078J78R45), 
- a [barcode scanner](https://www.amazon.de/NETUM-Barcodescanner-Bar-code-USB-Kabel-USB-Anschluss/dp/B01M73VPXI), 
- a [card reader module](https://www.amazon.de/RFID-Arduino-deutscher-Anleitung-RFID-Schl%C3%BCsselanh%C3%A4nger/dp/B00L6Z14T4), and
- some [jumper wires (female to female)](https://www.amazon.de/AZDelivery-Jumper-Arduino-Raspberry-Breadboard/dp/B07KYHBVR7)

#### Wiring

Connect the barcode scanner to a USB port of the Raspberry Pi and install the display and the card reader according to the wiring plan below. **Attention: There are two versions of the OLED display with different pinouts. On some the pins VCC and GND can also be positioned in reverse order. Please take this into account when wiring!**

#### Enclosure

3D-printed enclosure:
- STL-Files: [bottom](https://github.com/HappylabWien/raspi-fabman/blob/master/MicroPosEnclosureBottom.stl) and [cover](https://github.com/HappylabWien/raspi-fabman/blob/master/MicroPosEnclosureCover.stl)
- [Matching Screws](https://minischrauben.com/blech-holzschrauben-bund-linsenkopf--46209.html) (16x)
- [Barcode label for Reset an Undo](https://github.com/HappylabWien/raspi-fabman/blob/master/barcodes_RESET_UNDO.pdf)
   - Scan RESET to cancel current sale
   - Scan UNDO to remove the last item you scanned from the cart

### Software Installation

#### Install Image File

You can [download this image (zip-file, ca. 1.3 GB)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11m_erBqufvHFaryymkIm5_6_yDtTD6Tx/view?usp=sharing), unzip it and install it on your SD card (min. size 8 GB). We suggest to use the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) for this purpose.

#### Configure WiFi

Prior to the first boot you need to set up the WiFi configuration. In the /boot/ directory, open `wpa_supplicant.conf` and enter your Wifi parameters (ssid and password:
```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=<Insert 2 letter ISO 3166-1 country code here>

network={
 ssid="<Name of your wireless LAN>"
 psk="<Password for your wireless LAN>"
}
```
If needed, you find more detailed istructions [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md). 

When you have done this, insert the SD card into the Raspberry and power it on. It will now automatically connect to your WiFi and receive an IP address from your DHCP server. 

You can login via ssh on `raspi-fabman.local` with username `pi` and password `raspberry`.
For security reasons you are strongly advised to change the password of the default user on your Raspberry Pi according to this [Howto](https://www.theurbanpenguin.com/raspberry-pi-changing-the-default-users-password-and-creating-addtional-accounts/).

#### Update raspi-fabman Library

Get the latest version of the `raspi-fabman` library:
- Login to your Raspberry Pi via ssh (user pi)
- go to the fabman directory: `cd /home/pi/raspi-fabman`
- get newest version: `git pull origin master`

### Configuration

#### Connect to Fabman

[Create a Fabman Bridge API key](https://help.fabman.io/article/32-create-a-bridge-api-key) for your MicroPOS equipment in Fabman. If it doesnâ€™t yet exist, create a new equipment in Fabman first and then create an API key for it. 

Login to the Raspberry Pi (`raspi-fabman.local`) via ssh and configure your fabman settings in `/home/pi/raspi-fabman/fabman.json`:
```
{
	"api_url_base"       : "https://fabman.io/api/v1/",
	"reader_type"        : "MFRC522",
	"display"            : "sh1106",
	"api_token"          : "XXXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXX"
}
```
You just need to set the `api_token` created before.

#### Articles Database

The article list with the prices are saved in a CSV file. An unique number is assigned to each article, which can then be printed out as a barcode. Here's an example for `/home/pi/raspi-fabman/articles.csv` (columns: id for barcode, article name, article price):
```
1234567,Plywood,1.00
7654321,Screw,2.00
1111111,Endmill,3.00
```

### Run MicroPOS

To start the program run:
```
cd /home/pi/raspi-fabman
python3 micropos.py
```

If you like to start MicroPOS automatically during the boot process of the Raspberry Pi add the following line to `/etc/rc.local` *before* the line `exit 0`:
```
runuser -l pi -c "cd /home/pi/raspi-fabman;/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/raspi-fabman/micropos.py >> /home/pi/raspi-fabman/log/micropos.log 2>&1 &"
```

## Vending Machine

We are currently working on an open source extension for Fabman for material sales. In principle, it is a cabinet with many scales inside. The products are placed on the scales.

The use case then looks like this for the members:
1. Open the cabinet using a chip card
2. Remove the required items
3. Close the cabinet door
3. Weighing is done before and after the transaction. The system therefore knows who has withdrawn how many of which articles. Charges are then automatically generated in Fabman for the articles.

The system is currently being tested at [Happylab](https://www.happylab.at) in Vienna. As soon as I find the time, I'll document it here. Thank you for your patience!
