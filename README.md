## MicroPOS

MicroPOS is a simple point of sale solution for Fabman. All you need is 
- a [RasPi 3](https://www.amazon.de/UCreate-Raspberry-Pi-Desktop-Starter/dp/B07BNPZVR7), 
- a [display](https://www.amazon.de/AZDelivery-Display-Arduino-Raspberry-Gratis/dp/B078J78R45), 
- a [barcode scanner](https://www.amazon.de/NETUM-Barcodescanner-Bar-code-USB-Kabel-USB-Anschluss/dp/B01M73VPXI), and 
- a [card reader module](https://www.amazon.de/RFID-Arduino-deutscher-Anleitung-RFID-Schl%C3%BCsselanh%C3%A4nger/dp/B00L6Z14T4).

The sales process is then very simple and intuitive:
1. Scan the items you want
2. Swipe a member card to complete the sale
3. An invoice line is then automatically created for the member.

The article list with the prices are saved in a CSV file. An unique number is assigned to each article, which can then be printed out as a barcode. Here's an example for `/home/pi/raspi-fabman/articles.csv` (columns: id for barcode, article name, article price):
```
1234567,Schraube,1.00
7654321,Plexiglas,2.00
1111111,Fr√§ser,3.00
```

Configure your fabman settings in `/home/pi/raspi-fabman/fabman.json`:
```
{
	"api_url_base"       : "https://fabman.io/api/v1/",
	"reader_type"        : "MFRC522",
	"display"            : "sh1106",
	"api_token"          : "XXXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXX"
}
```
You just need to set the `api_token`.

Connect the barcode scanner to a USB port of the Raspberry Pi and install the display and the card reader according to the wiring plan below.

To start the program login via ssh on `raspi-fabman.local` (username `pi`, password `raspberry`) and run:
```
cd /home/pi/raspi-fabman
python3 micropos.py
```
